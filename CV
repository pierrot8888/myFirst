September 2010 – March 2016
Position: Manager at Deloitte UK – Member of the Actuarial Modelling Centre (AMC)
My main projects include: building a model for carrying forward the economic capital of the non-profits business, building the ALM model of an annuity portfolio, implementation of a smoothing surplus for a with-profits fund and coding the tax capability of a complex ALM model. 
For each of these projects, I was responsible for:
•	Analysing the features to implement. I presented the findings and the technical specifications to internal and external stakeholders
•	Setting out the plan for implementing the changes proposed in the technical specifications,
•	Reviewing the code of the junior developers (up to 3) to ensure best practice were followed
•	Responsible for owning the model: collating the code, coding the complex functionalities and ensuring the merged version works accurately
•	Performing the tests of the model, conducting the analysis of the gaps between the old model and the new one and presented them to senior stakeholders
•	Managing team’s delivery and internal and external stakeholder relationships
•	Writing the documentation of the model and ensuring it is compliant with TAS M

Other modelling and non-modelling Projects:
•	I developed a pricing model for a protection product based on the Prophet Permanent Health Insurance library for a UK mutual. Based on the client’s requirements, I customised the library and tested my changes with spreadsheets where the key functionalities were implemented. I conducted also a sensitivity analysis of the profitability to changes in assumptions such as lapse rates. I summarised these results in a report delivered with the model to the client.
•	For a large American life insurer, I have conducted a model rationalisation of its Prophet model. I was responsible for reviewing the model (organisation of the assumption tables, use of the indicators, coding style and advanced functionalities such as dynamic looping and extended formulae). Based on my findings, I presented to the client the areas to improve and proposed a plan for implementing these changes. I conducted the model rationalisation (coding and testing) and wrote the documentation of the new model.
•	I reviewed and made improvement to a model for projecting the capital positions of a with-profits fund in a Solvency II basis. The project’s objective was to determine a sustainable strategy for distributing the fund’s estate.
•	I built, implemented and documented a stochastic model for projecting the capital position of the Equity Release portfolio for a major life insurer. I also provided guidance to my client on methodology for projecting the future draws and for calculating the non-negative equity guarantees.
•	I lead the actuarial team (3 junior actuaries) within a multi-disciplinary IFRS4 project. The project’s objective was assessing the impact of the principles as set out in the exposure draft published in June 2013, on its balance-sheet.

I have also quickened the final stage “Analysis of Changes” by using cross tests. Along my secondment, I managed junior actuaries (up to 6). I also trained them to Prophet (Unit-linked and ALS libraries) and to the concept of market consistent valuation.
•	I developed a tool for ALM for a retail bank with the modelling platform Prophet.
